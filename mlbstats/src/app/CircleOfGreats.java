 * Start in 1968 (2013 - 45?)
 * Select top player of that year + holdovers
 * 2-N (6?) carry over to the next year
 * If number of new nominees falls below N (15?), include the following year as well
 * Eligible = 10 years or minimum value (40 WAR?)
 * Once we run out of years, we start replaying top scorers, N at a time
 *   Pick the top M*N scores overall, and then divide them up into X-N votes
 *   Last day accepts N players, so the last few added can make it
 *   (For instance, 30*3, divided into 28 votes)
 * 
 * Value = WAR, wWAR, normWAR (WAR650*WAR)
 * Maybe even voting: HR, RBI, HOF Monitor, HOF Standards, Black/Gray Ink, WAR, wWAR, JAWS, Steroids
